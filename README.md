# NLP-to-SQL

NLP-to-SQL enables users to interact with databases using natural language queries, automatically translating them into SQL statements. This project aims to bridge the gap between intuitive language and technical database management, making data access simpler and more efficient for users of all backgrounds.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts everyday language into syntactically correct SQL queries.
- **Database Compatibility**: Supports popular relational databases for flexible deployment.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows for easy integration of new NLP models or database engines.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to streamline the query process for both technical and non-technical users.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- SQL
- Machine Learning (NLP)
- Flask (or other relevant frameworks)

## Usage

1. Input your question or request in natural language.
2. The system analyzes and translates your input into an SQL query.
3. The SQL query is executed on the connected database, and results are returned.

## Example

- **Input**: “Show me all customers who purchased products in July.”
- **Output**: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE purchase_date BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2023-07-31';`
